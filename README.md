## ZenPlace:
Our first project for a Hackathon: ZenPlace. <br>

## What is ZenPlace? 

ZenPlace is a virtual environment that uses ChatGPT for the user to vent some of their problems. In addition, you learn about Zazen's and Yoga's Meditation, Lo-Fi and ASMR music at homepage. The project works as a secondary emotional support tool and is NOT intended to replace the qualified work of mental health professionals (psychologists, psychiatrists, and others). ZenPlace encourages and highlights the importance of mental health care and professional monitoring. <br>

## Where you could find our application?

I made the deploy of [ZenPlace](https://zenplace-hackathon.vercel.app/index.html) in Vercel, so it's now online for the public to use our services.
